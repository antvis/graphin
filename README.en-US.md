Graphin, short for Graph Insight, is a React component library built on top of G6. It is designed to be simple, efficient, and ready to use out of the box.

The technical foundation of Graphin consists of G6 and React, providing both Graphin and GISDK based on the depth of integration into the project.

- [Graphin](https://github.com/antvis/Graphin/tree/v3/packages/graphin) can be viewed as a canvas component suitable for graph visualization scenarios.
- [GISDK](https://github.com/antvis/Graphin/tree/v3/packages/gi-sdk) can render a complete graph visualization analysis module through configuration and assets, making it suitable for graph analysis scenarios.

The diagram below illustrates the relationship between Graphin and GISDK:
